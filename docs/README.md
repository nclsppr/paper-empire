# Papers Empire

Papers Empire is a browser-based incremental game that runs entirely on the client side. The experience is intentionally light-hearted: you're modernising an industrial print shop a la Victor Buck Services while channeling the vibe of workplace sitcoms.

The UI is now split across dedicated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets for easier maintenance. Additional helper modules power the modifier builder math and god-mode utilities so they can be unit-tested in isolation.

For a deeper dive into the architecture, commands, and debugging notes see [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Versioned Change History

Track meaningful milestones in the project:

- **0.1** – Initial concept and single-file setup.
- **0.2** – Fix interactive flow so clicking and buy buttons immediately update the game state and UI.
- **0.3** – Stabilise production modifiers, surface their impact in the UI, and add targeted unit tests.
- **0.4** – Introduce the hidden “renard” god mode with time-scaling controls and supporting tests.
- **0.5** – Split the UI into modular assets, cache DOM references for better performance, and add extensive inline documentation plus project-wide docs.
- **0.6** – Externalise i18n, add German/Luxembourgish, refresh the mobile UI (sticky header, ripple, layout fixes), and add Playwright layout tests. See `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for details.
- **0.7** – Persistence + achievements, SEO metadata, dual deployment (game root + docs sous `/docs/`), et grosse passe accessibilité (skip links, ARIA, panneau d’options). Voir `accessibility.md` pour le détail.

When you make notable changes (new features, mechanics, UI improvements), append a new entry with an incremented version number and a short description of what changed.

## SEO & Deployment

- `index.html` now embarques canonical/meta tags, Open Graph/Twitter cards, and JSON-LD schema data to help Google understand the app.
- `robots.txt` (root) allows crawling and points to `sitemap.xml`, which currently indexes the main game (`/`) and the Retype docs (`/docs/`).
- A dedicated social card is stored at `assets/images/social-card.svg` and referenced in Open Graph/Twitter meta tags.
- The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) builds the docs, bundles the game assets, copies `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`, and deploys everything via GitHub Pages (Pages source = GitHub Actions).

## Accessibility

- Features (skip link, ARIA regions, log announcements, accessibility panel for high contrast/large text/reduced motion) are documented in `accessibility.md`.
- Preferences persist automatically (localStorage) and are applied before rendering to avoid flashes.
