# Release Notes

## 0.6 – Multilingual Mobile Refresh
- Externalised the i18n catalog into individual language bundles and added German + Luxembourgish translations alongside French and English.
- Rebuilt the layout for mobile devices: sticky header, centred grid, ripple feedback on the print button, and Playwright layout tests targeting iPhone 15 Pro Max ensure alignment.
- Added Playwright + Node test scripts via `package.json` and configured CI-ready commands for both unit and layout checks.

Refer to previous versions in `README.md` for earlier milestones. Create a new section below for each future release.
